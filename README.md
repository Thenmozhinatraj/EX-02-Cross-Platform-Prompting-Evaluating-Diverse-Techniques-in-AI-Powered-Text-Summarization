# EX-02-Cross-Platform-Prompting-Evaluating-Diverse-Techniques-in-AI-Powered-Text-Summarization

## AIM
To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) across different AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot) in a specific task: text summarization.

## Scenario:
You are part of a content curation team for an educational platform that delivers quick summaries of research papers to undergraduate students. Your task is to summarize a 500-word technical article on "The Basics of Blockchain Technology" using multiple AI platforms and prompting strategies.

Your goal is to determine which combination of prompting technique + platform provides the best summary in terms of:

Accuracy

Coherence

Simplicity

Speed

User experience

## Algorithm
```
1. Input Selection – Choose a 500-word article on The Basics of Blockchain Technology.

2. Prompt Design – Prepare four types of prompts:

   Zero-shot

   Few-shot (with 2–3 examples)

   Chain-of-thought (step-by-step reasoning)

   Role-based (e.g., "Act as a teacher")
4. Platform Execution – Run each prompt on ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Copilot.

5. Summary Collection – Gather the generated summaries from each platform.

6. Evaluation Metrics – Compare outputs based on:

   Accuracy (content correctness)

   Coherence (logical flow)

   Simplicity (ease of understanding)

   Speed (time taken for response)

   User Experience (ease of prompting & clarity of output)

7. Comparison Table – Organize findings in a comparative table for clarity.

8. Final Analysis – Identify the most effective platform + prompting strategy combination.

## Result
The experiment successfully compared different prompting techniques across AI platforms and showed that the quality of summaries depends on both the platform and the chosen prompting method.
